/*public Task 5: Using throws Keyword
Statement: Create a program where a method reads data from a file. Use the throws keyword to
declare that the method might throw an IOException. In the main method, call this file-reading
method and handle the IOException in a try-catch block. This demonstrates the use of throws
in a method signature and catch in the calling method. */
